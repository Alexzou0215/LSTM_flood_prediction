# LSTM Flood Prediction Project

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and related files for LSTM-based flood prediction.

## Notebooks

- [Model_testing.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Alexzou0215/LSTM_flood_prediction/blob/main/Model_testing.ipynb)  
  Open and run the testing notebook on Google Colab.

- [Model_training.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Alexzou0215/LSTM_flood_prediction/blob/main/Model_training.ipynb)  
  Open and run the training notebook on Google Colab.

## Files

- `1256.csv` — Dataset file used in the project.  
- `lstm_flood_pro10_model2.h5_best_val.weights` — Pretrained model weights.  
- `lstm_flood_pro10_model2_scaler.pkl` — Scaler object for data preprocessing.
